Certainly! Let's break down the code for beginners:

1. `import {Server} from "socket.io"`: This line is importing the `Server` class from the "socket.io" library. The "socket.io" library is commonly used for handling real-time communication between clients and servers.

2. `class SocketService { ... }`: This line defines a new class called `SocketService`. In object-oriented programming, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Here, `SocketService` will be a blueprint for managing WebSocket communication.

3. `private _io: Server;`: This line declares a private property `_io` of type `Server` within the `SocketService` class. The underscore before `io` is a common convention to indicate that it's a private property.

4. `constructor() { ... }`: This is the constructor method of the class. The constructor is a special method that gets called when an object of the class is created. In this case, it initializes the `SocketService` object.

5. `console.log("Init Socket Service.....")`: This line prints a message to the console, indicating that the Socket Service is being initialized. This can be helpful for debugging or understanding when this part of the code is executed.

6. `this._io = new Server();`: Here, a new instance of the `Server` class from "socket.io" is created and assigned to the `_io` property. This instance represents the WebSocket server that will handle communication between clients and the server.

In summary, this code defines a class (`SocketService`) that uses the "socket.io" library to create a WebSocket server (`_io`) for real-time communication. The constructor logs a message to the console when the service is initialized, and it creates an instance of the `Server` class to handle WebSocket communication.
